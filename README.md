Wrecks and Obstructions Introduction- 
The Coast Survey's Automated Wreck and Obstruction Information System (AWOIS) database was used for this project visualizations and analysis. AWOIS is a valuable tool and information source for marine archaeologists and historians, fishermen, divers, salvage operators, and others in the marine community. It contains information on over 10,000 submerged wrecks and obstructions in the coastal waters of the United States. The information includes latitude and longitude of each feature along with a brief historic description.

My goal is to succesfully provide you with visualizations of the different shipwrecks, obstruction types and their locations in the US over the years. I hope you are able to find each tab fun and informative.
